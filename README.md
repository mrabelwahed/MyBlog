## How to be an android developer Expert
In this Post  I am going to talk about the steps you should follow to be an  android developer expert  in the market. At the beginning, I would like to say something about that. The corner stone of success in any field is to love what you do so if you do not have passion to learn android development you will waste your time.It is  a long journey of learning and practice.To be expert , there are many steps you should follow. Here are the steps:



Mastering Java Programming and Kotlin
Mastering Design Patterns
Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms
Mastering Android development SDK
Mastering the trending tools and libraries
Mastering the Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob
Version Control and Continuous Integration Tools
Having Problem Solving Skill
Having Self Learning Skill
Having Github,StackOverflow Accounts
Now let us talk more about each point  form my point of view to be an android developer expert:

Java is an amazing,easy,portable language  used to develop android native applications.There are three versions of Java(J2SE,J2EE,J2ME).For android development we use J2SE(Java Standard Edition). You should learn it very well.The more you practice in Java,The more you will be android ninja.the following are some resources for learning

Effective Java Book
Kotlin is the new supported language for android developement.It is easy,powerful and has more powerful features than Java Language.If you learn it, you will be happy with nice and easy coding and you can code  both  in Java and kotlin in the same project.Consequently, it is fun.The following are some resources for Kotlin Learning:

Kotlin Documnetation
Kotlin For Android Developers book
Kotlin in Action Book
Design patterns are group of solutions for common problems.They developed by Group of Pioneers in Software Engineering Field. Design Patterns have three categories i.e,Creational ,Structural and Behavioral Patterns.You should first understand the problem before  trying to use the pattern for writing better and efficient code.The following  are some resources for learning design patterns:

Data Structures and algorithms are the corner stones of your life as a software engineer.We develop apps for mobile platform. We have limited resources of memory and processors .So we want efficient ways to store data in small size of memory. We always want our program to run fast with any size of inputs and here data structures and  algorithms techniques appear on the scene .

To be an android developer expert , you should be professional in data structures and algorithms techniques.The following are some resources to master data structures and algorithms:

DataStructures and Algorithms in Java book
Introduction to Algorithms Book
Android OS(operating system) is a great open source operating system designed on the top of Linux Kernel .It is working on Smart Devices Like smart phones, watches,TVs and many embedded devices.you should install latest version of Android Studio and get started  to work with android Software development kit.

You should study the basics very well to be able to build awesome apps .The following are some resources to master android SDK:

The Big Nerd Ranch Book
Introduction to android development Book
 Trending Tools And Libraries: There are some useful libraries that accelerate your development as android developer expert and save a lot of time like:

Retrofit
GSON
RxJava
Dagger2
Glide
EventBus
Parceler
Architecture Components
Roboelectric
Espersso
More  .
Clean architecture is one of the best architectures for software development in general and for android apps specific also.This architecture divides your app into three separated layers  as following:

Presentation Layer: this layer is responsible for UI and you can use MVP or MVVM with Data binding
Domain Layer: this layer is responsible for business only
Data Layer: this layer is responsible for data from different sources like database,network and files
You should be familiar with Version Control Tools like Git  to manage your code history and collaborate with your team and Continuous integration tools  like Jenkins and Travis to make sure you don't break the team commit and push formats and do not break the code base of your team.

Problem solving is an essential skill for any  programmer because the programming language is  a tool of writing the solution of a problem only  but the solution lies in logical thinking .The more you train your mind to solve problems ,The more you will be a better software engineer.

For Software Domain I think the websites like the following are a great place to solve great problems and enhance your problem solving skills:

HackerRank
CodeWars
Codility.   
Self Learning is a vital Skill for your career as software engineer. There is no end of knowledge and science and every day there is new technology comes to life.So to be able to update your self with the new stuff ,you should learn every day and read more .Do not wait someone to teach you something. Be proactive and learn by your self .

Github and Stackoverflow are famous websites for code repository hosting and for asking and answering questions .As a software engineer, you should have account on GitHub.You can  share and contribute in open source projects.This makes you a better developer and also famous  in your community.

At the end, I would like to say that all the previous points are of  my point of view to be an android developer expert  in the market.I hope this article will help you to start your journey of android   development.
